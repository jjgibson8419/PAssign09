Programming assignment 9 for CSCI1302
This program uses a provided employeeData.dat file that has binary information that describes employee id's, employee salaries, and employee service time amounts. 
Using this provided file, I was tasked with creating a project that reads the information, processes the information to provide raises based upon employee salaries and service times. 
In addition to this, I created an Employee class which houses the information relating to an employee and methods for raise percentages and calculations. 
Finally, I had to output the original file information with the updated information, while instantiating each individual employee using the Employee class that I created 
within the project. Then I wrote the information to a new binary file called employeeDataProcessed.dat.
